1- Send AsynchronousRequest

[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:[[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:url] queue:[[NSOperationQueue alloc] init] completionHandler:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSData *data, NSError *error) {
        
        if (error) {
            [self.delegate fetchingGroupsFailedWithError:error];
        } else {
            [self.delegate receivedGroupsJSON:data];
        }
    }];
    
Description : Send AsynchronousRequest



2- performSelector With Object data passing 

NSArray * arrayOfThingsIWantToPassAlong = 
    [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"first", @"second", nil];

[self performSelector:@selector(fooFirstInput:) 
           withObject:arrayOfThingsIWantToPassAlong  
           afterDelay:15.0];
           
Descriptions :
You need to encapsulate the data you want to send along into some single Objective C object (e.g. a NSArray, a NSDictionary, some custom Objective C type) 
and then pass it through the[NSObject performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:] method that is well known and loved.

3 - respondsToSelector
if ([self.delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(engineDidStartRunning:)]) {
        [self.delegate engineDidStartRunning:self];
    }
    
Description : 
You use it pretty much just when you think you need to: to check to see if an object implements the method you are about to call. Usually this is done when you have an optional methods or an informal protocol.

I've only ever used respondsToSelector when I'm writing code that must communicate with a delegate object.
